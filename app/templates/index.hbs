    <h1>No Breaks</h1>
    <p>
      We are a raiding guild on US-Thrall, current tier progress is 9/13 Mythic HFC.
      Although we're not hardcore raiders, we buckle down when necessary to get the job done.
      No Breaks prides itself on creating a close-knit community with our friendly,
      albeit weird, members. We have a guild leader that isn't a scrub and we wear pink on Fridays!
    </p>

    <h2>Plans for Legion</h2>
    <p>
      No Breaks will be raiding in Legion! Newly created for this expansion is 
      a weekend team and we are looking for some new members to fill all roles
      in this exciting new endeavor. This of course will be in addition to our
      weekday team that has already established itself as a force to be reckoned with!
      Head on over to the 'Raiding' section to find out more, or head to the 'Joining'
      section to find information on how to join.
